--------------------

This folder contains an educational pipeline design tool for young engineers.

Start in this order:

1) Make sure Python 3 is installed on your computer.
   - In a terminal/command prompt, run:  python --version
   - If it shows a version (e.g. Python 3.10), you are OK.

2) Install required Python libraries (once):
   - Open terminal in this folder and run:
       pip install numpy scipy pandas

3) Run the example calculation:
   - In the same terminal, run:
       python calculations.py
   - You should see a full pipeline analysis printed (flow, pressure drop, stress, safety check).

4) Learn how to use the tool:
   - Open calculations.py and read the comments at the top.
   - Treat it as a template: you will later change only the input numbers (flow, diameter, length, etc.), not the formulas.

5) IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:
   - This tool is for education and preliminary understanding only.
   - It is NOT a substitute for:
       * Detailed design by qualified engineers
       * Full compliance with ASME/API/SHELL DEP/company standards
       * Peer review and senior engineer approval
   - Always verify calculations separately and follow applicable codes and company procedures.

Suggested next steps:
- Add more example scripts (e.g. my_case_1.py) that call PipelineAnalysis with your own project data.
- Put this folder under Git version control and push it to GitHub for tracking and sharing.
